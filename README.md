M - Reduced adjacency matrix for a graph: The i-th roww of the matrix containes the neighburs of vertex i. For example, the reduced adjacency matric of a square

                                    |      |

                                    3------2       is
M = [1,3]
    [0,2]
    [1,3]
    [0,2]
Vertex 0 is often taken to be the source.
